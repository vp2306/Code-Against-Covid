Verifme is a full stack web application built with NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, and deployed to Heroku. It is a platform where Canadian high school students can, in Reddit-like fashion, share posts about homework problems, upvote/downvote other students' posts, and engage in meaningful discussions by writing comments.
